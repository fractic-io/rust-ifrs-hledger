Rust utility to generate "IFRS-compliant" (\*) hledger files based on a highly specific CSV format of company transactions.

The expected input CSV format will be documented here in the future, once it gets more fleshed out. If you're actually thinking of using this, you're probably already the kind of person who can just find out by reading the code aha. <3

For now this is just made open-source as-is, with *absolutely no guarantees*. Probably don't use this for your taxes. Hopefully over the next couple years it will become good enough to rely on for actual complex company finances.

\*: I'm not an accountant, so take this with a grain of salt. It's just my honest best attempt.
